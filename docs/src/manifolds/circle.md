# [The $1$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb S^1$ represented by angles](@id CircleManifold)
The circle $\mathbb S^1$ posesses the following instances of the
abstract types [`Manifold`](@ref), [`MPoint`](@ref), and [`TVector`](@ref).
```@autodocs
Modules = [Manopt]
Pages = ["manifolds/Circle.jl"]
Order = [:type]
```
It can also be represented in an embedding, see [`Sphere`](@ref SphereManifold),
as vectors in $\mathbb R^2$ of unit length.

# Specific Functions
