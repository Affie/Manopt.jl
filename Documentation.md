# Manifold optimization
The `Manopt.jl` Julia package provides all necessary tools to perform optimization on manifolds and apply these methods to manifold-valued image processing. This file intends to fix notations both mathematical and with respect to source code throughout this package. For an introduction to manifolds, we refer to [AMS08].

## Manifolds

All manifolds inherit from `Manifold`to store their main properties, which is most prominently the manifold dimension and the name of the manifolds. Furthermore there are two types accompanying each manifold â€“ a point on the manifold inheriting from `MPoint` and the tangential vector `MTVector`. For both the term manifold is shortened to `M` for concise naming. Each manifold also inherits such a short abbreviation, see `Abbr.` in the following table.
Furthermore there is an abstract type `MatrixManifold` (Abbreviation `MM`) that overloads the operands `*,/,+,-` for the `MMPoint`.
Furthermore each `MMPOint`is indeed a matrix, so they also posess an array to store its decomposition, namely for \(\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb R^{n,m}\) its singular value decomposition \(\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}\).

File | Abbr. |  Manifold \(\mathcal M\) | Comment
-----|-------|--------------------------|---------
`Circle.jl`  | `S1`| \(1\)-Sphere \(\mathbb S^1\) | represented as angles \(p_i\in[-\pi,\pi)\)
`Euclidean.jl` | `Rn` | \(n\)-dimensional Euclidean space \(\mathbb R^n\)
`Sphere.jl` | `Sn` | \(n\)-dimensional Sphere \(\mathbb S^n\) | embedded in \(\mathbb R^{n+1}\)

## A summary of notations
The Riemannian Manifold will always be denoted by \(\mathcal M\) its dimension
by \(d\in\mathbb N\), and points on \(\mathcal M\) by \(p,q\) or \(p_i\),
\(i\in\mathcal I\), for more than 2 points.We denote the tangential space at
\(p\in\mathcal M\) by \(\mathrm{T}_p\mathcal M\) and the Riemannian metric by
\(g_p(\xi,\nu) = \langle \xi,\nu\rangle_p\), where we denote tangential vectors
\(\xi,\nu\in\mathrm{T}_p\mathcal M\) by small greek letters, and in most cases
omit denoting the basis point \(p\), just if a confucion might arise or we
would like to emphasize the tangential space, we write \(\xi_p,\nu_p\).

With capital letters \(X,Y,Z\) we refer to vector fields on a manifold,
\(X\colon \mathcal M \to \mathrm{T}\mathcal M\), such that \(X(p) = X_p
\in \mathrm{T}\mathcal M\). Whenever we require to look at charts, they are
indicated by \(\varphi,\psi\colon\mathcal U \to\mathbb R^d\),
\(\mathcal U\subset\mathcal M\) with e.g. \(x=\varphi(p)\), \(y=\varphi(q)\).
When explicitly speaking of matrices, we employ \(A,B,C\in\mathbb R^{n,n}\).

We denote the exponential map by \(\exp_p\colon\mathrm{T}_p\mathcal M\to\mathcal M\) and its (locally defined) inverse by \(\log_p\colon\mathcal M \to\mathrm{T}_p\mathcal M\).

Finally functions are denoted by \(f,g\colon\Omega\to\mathcal M\),
\(\Omega\subset\mathbb R^m\), where we
use the short hand notation of \(f_i = f(x_i)\), \(i\in\mathcal I\), for given fixed samples of a function \(f\) and functions defined on a manifold by \(F,G\colon\mathcal M\to\mathbb R^m\). The notion of samples valued is especially employed, when a Function \(F\) depends on fixed given data and variable data, e.g. \(F(p;f) = d_{\mathcal M}^2(p,f)\) is meant as a function \(F\colon \mathcal M\to\mathbb R\) defined for some fixed (sampled) data \(f\in\mathcal M\).
